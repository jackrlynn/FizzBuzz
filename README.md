# FizzBuzz Web App
## Overview
The FizzBuzz app is an interactive web environment in which users can play and utilize the functionality of the classic
game FizzBuzz. <b>Generator</b> is an interactive webpage in which users can enter parameters for start, stop, Fizz, and
Buzz numbers and get output a comma-separated list of the range's respective FizzBuzz values. <b>Game</b> is another webpage
in which users can play the FizzBuzz game with standard parameters--3 being Fizz and 5 being Buzz. Both webpages are 
connected by a homepage.
## How to Use
### Method 1: Integrated Web App
1. Run the main function in the following file, either using `Javac` or and IDE.<br>
```
src/main/java/net/codejava/implementation/ImplementationApplication.java
```
2. Open a web-browser (Chrome-recommended) and go to the localhost.
```
htp://localhost:8080/
```
3. Enjoy the website as normal! The individual pages should be intuitive to use.
### Method 2: JavaScript-Enabled Webpages
1. Open any of the HTML files in a web browser (Chrome-recommended).
2. Enjoy the webpages as normal. Note the navigation between pages won't work, as `GET` requests are handled by SpringBoot
and won't work without the app running.
